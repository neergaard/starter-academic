**[ 08-05-2021 ]**  On the personal news side: I was married today to my beautiful girlfriend of 12 years! From now on I will publish under my new last name, Alexander Neergaard Zahid, PhD.

**[ 15-04-2021 ]**  Today, I am happy to announce that I am a recipient of a [LF Postdoc grant](https://lundbeckfonden.com/uddelinger-priser/nyheder/lundbeckfonden-stoetter-yngre-forskere-med-69-millioner-kr) from Lundbeck Fonden! Starting September 2021, I will be a postdoctoral scholar at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk) working together with Professor Morten Mørup, PhD, on deep unsupervised learning methods for EEG and sleep analysis.

**[ 07-01-2021 ]**  My preliminary work on multi-modal sleep event detection has been published on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02530).

**[ 31-09-2020 ]**  I am now officially Alexander Neergaard Olesen, PhD!

**[ 22-09-2020 ]**  Today, I successfully defended my thesis *Deep Learning Methods for Clinical Sleep Analysis* with unanimous approval from the assessment committee!

**[ 07-05-2020 ]**  As of today, I am now a research scientist self-employed in Somnoscient!

**[ 15-04-2020 ]**  I wrote a small article for a Danish industry magazine about some of my research, check it out [here](http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/TechMedia/Medicoteknik/2020/?page=24).

**[ 13-04-2020 ]**  The amazing work of my fellow PhD student Andreas Brink-Kjær on automatic arousal detection has been published in Clinical Neurophysiology. Check out the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2020.02.027) or read the preprint version [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01700).

**[ 10-04-2020 ]**  My conference paper on improving single-EEG arousal detection using deep transfer learning was accepted for EMBC2020. Read the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05111).
