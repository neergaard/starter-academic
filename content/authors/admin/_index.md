I am a research scientist and biomedical engineer with special interests in signal processing and machine learning for computational sleep science.
I design algorithms and data processing pipelines for modeling, analysis and visualisation of physiological signals such as EEG, EOG and EMG obtained from nocturnal PSG recordings.
Through this work, I hope to further our collective understanding of sleep pathologies, and how they impact human health.
